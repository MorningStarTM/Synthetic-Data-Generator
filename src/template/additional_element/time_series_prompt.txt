Use the provided statistical summary for each column (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, trend direction, seasonality indicators, correlation matrix, and value distributions) to guide data generation.
Ensure all generated values stay within realistic ranges, preserve inter-column correlations, maintain temporal continuity, and reflect observed trends and seasonality.
Introduce mild stochastic noise consistent with the original variance, but avoid outliers unless explicitly indicated by the stats.
The target column must respect its historical dependency on other features and past values.
